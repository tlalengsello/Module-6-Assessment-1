                    <h3>LOST FOREST</h3>
                    <p>Lost Forest is an isolated area of pine trees separated from the nearest contiguous forest land by forty miles of arid desert. There are no springs or surface water in Lost Forest, and much of the southwest portion of the natural area is covered by large shifting sand dunes that are slowly encroaching on the forest.</p>
                    
                      <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</p>
                      <p>The lost forest is to the south of the main entrance. </p>
