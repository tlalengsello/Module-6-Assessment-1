                    <h3>MONKEY TRAIL</h3>
                    <p>As the tagline, "Where humans are caged and monkeys run wild!," suggests, the primary experience at Monkey Jungle has guests travel through the park on a caged walkway while different primates roam semi-freely in a natural habitat. Monkey Jungle is one of just a few protected habitats for primates in the United States, and the only one that the public can explore. Guests can embark on trips through a Southeast Asian Wild Monkey Pool & Trail, the Cameroon Gorilla Forest, the Amazonian Rainforest, and visit tropical birds in Wings of Love. Monkey Jungle also provides a home to animals such as: sloths, multiple turtle species, and an iguana.</p>

                      <p>The monkey trail is found in the east of the entrance</p>
